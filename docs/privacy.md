Tamako collects information from you, users, from [Discord](https://discord.com) in order for some functionality to work. These information are needed so that Tamako could keep track of who owns who, and who's what is whose. Discord itself does not disclose critical information you've sent to them to us, developers, when interacting with the API. However, there might be times that you became paranoid of how some bot you use collect data, how & where do they post it?

## What data do we collect?
Per server, we store the giveaways/tickets/Server Stats and other settings (such as Member Greeting System) that relates to the bot. Only Tamako and Tamako only has access to the Databases. The data will be only altered with the owners/admin's concern.
<br />
Per User, we store their guild id and experience points that are only initialised if and only if the admins toggle xp system on the server
We also Store their Author ID to add Tamako coins & maintain a global profile like that of [Mai](http://mai-san.ml/) and Proxies Information(only if the user has registered)
<br/>
<b>Tamako only stores necessary data.</b>

## Why do we need the data?
Tamako needs this data to provide a seamless experience of her features for each server/guild & user, Tamako will never sneakily fetches your data.

## How do we handle the data?
Tamako Stores your Data in [MongoDB](https://mongoosejs.com/) and [Redis](https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/references/client_references/client_ioredis/) through verified API wrapper.<br/>
We use MongoDB to store all the permanent Data and Redis for caching.
